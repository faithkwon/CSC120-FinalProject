The game I chose to create for the final project is a pretty basic-level business tycoon. I went into this project knowing that I wanted to have a few core variables: the business's funds, revenue, inventory, and the elements of each product in the inventory (i.e. name, price, demand, etc.). I also wanted to have an element of strategy and user input in this -- although I didn't end up implementing competing businesses, I implemented randomized roadblocks that force the user to switch up their strategy. I got really familiar with the sematics of HashTables and Random in this project, as I had to get really nitty gritty to get the results that I wanted. If I had unlimited time, I wish I could've figured out how to implement competing businesses in the game + other ways to win other than just completing 5 years in the business. I'm glad I figured out how to implement the demand index, but it was disappointing to not be able to get to everything I wanted. The most helpful piece of feedback was during one of the first code feedback sessions, where one of my classmates (I forget their name, unfortunately) suggested the randomized roadblock idea. I really enjoyed writing the code and implementing it, so I'm glad I got that feedback early on.
